    <a NAME="MENUBAR"></a><h3>Menubar</h3>
     <p>
      The Menubar contains the following choices:
    <ul>
      <li>
	<b>File</b>
	<ul>
	  <li>Print to printer/file <i>Print</i>
	  <li>Save the diagram as an image with  <i>Save Image</i>
	    You can choose between XPM/BMP/PNG og EPS.
	    The default is PNG. Every format exept EPS gives
	    a screendump (WYSIWYG). EPS is dynamic.
	  <li>Create your own positionfilter with
	    <a href="#FILTER" target><i>Change filter </i> </a>
	  <li>Quit the program with <i>Quit</i>
	</ul>
      <li>
	<b>Preferences</b>
	<ul>
	  <li>The user can save the actual set of window -size/pos,
	    position, type, model by  <i>Save preferences</i>.
	    The saved values will be reused next time T-series is started
	    or when the <i>Reset preferences</i> option is used.
	  <li>The prefernces are saved automatically at exit when the
	    <i>Save at exit</i> option is on.
	  <li> <i>Show postitions (DIANA) </i>
	    Displays all position names at the DIANA map in case of
	    linking between DIANA and T-series.
	    This option can distract the user at large datasets but
	    is ok for small sets...
	  <li>  <i>Show active position (DIANA) </i>
	    Shows just the name of the diagram position on the map
	    (recommended)
	  <li> <i> Vis timemark </i> shows a gray line at the current time
	    and a red line at the DIANA-time.
	</ul>
      <li>
	<b>Help</b>
	<ul>
	  <li><i>Manual</i> Shows this document
	  <li><i>About T-series..</i>Version number etc.

    <a NAME="DIANALINK"></a><h3>Linking to DIANA</h3>
    <br>
    T-series can link up to a <b>diana</b>-instance
    if DIANA is open to such linking. The linking is controlled by an
    external application (coserver) which is socket based.
    coserver starts automtically when needed.
    The user can couple by T-series and DIANA by activate the  
    <img SRC="connect.png"> in both applications.
    <p>
      After the linking the following happens:
    <ul>
      <li>T-series sends a full list of all positions to DIANA.
	Those will show up in the DIANA map as icons if the <i>Show icons (DIANA)</i>
	option is on. T-series Icons look like:<img SRC="ts_station.xpm">
      <li>BY choosing a position in DIANA, T-series will show the belonging Diagram.
      <li>By clicking<img SRC="ts_find.xpm"> T-series will  send
	a pointer to DIANA to find the position of the actual diagram.
    </ul>

    <a NAME="FILTER"></a><h3>Position filter</h3>
    <p>
      Its possible to build an overlay filter for your stationlist.
      To use the filter the  <img SRC="ts_filter.xpm"> option must be ON.
      There is a standardfilter which can be changed by the user in the
      position filter dialog: Changed filters can be saved for further use.
    <p>
      The dialog has two lists. The one on the left is a list off all
      stations foound in the datasets, The one in the right is the filter.

      You can choose positions in the filter and take them out by 
      <img SRC="delete.xpm"> ( or the DEL-key ).
      By pushing <img SRC="copy.xpm"> (or the SPACE-Key)
      The hightlighted position in the big list is copied into the filter.
      filter.
      <br><B>
	The filter can be reset to standard by
	på <img SRC="tb_refresh.xpm">

    <a NAME="WDB"></a><h3>Wdb Connection</h3>
    <p>
      From version 5.0 tseries is able to connect to a WDB database and
      get data interpolated on demand. <br>
      The Tab name is similar to the database-server which is used in the connection.
      <br>
      The user interface is coordinate based, you can choose coordinates
      by the lat/lon sliders, write them directly into the Lat/Lon textfields
      or click into any given place in the diana map to get the diagram for
      the specific coordinates. Remember to hold down the <i>SHIFT</i> button when
      you are in the profet-edit modus<p>
      All the modelnames,times and coordinate borders are selected from the database.
      When the database-tab is disabled, the connection to the database failed for some reason.

      <p>
     <b>CACHE</b><br>
      The database interpolates data for you on demand, for this, the server
      has to read all the fields nessecary to generate your diagram. If this
      is to slow (default > 1.5s) the cache button <img SRC="view-refresh.xpm"  BORDER=0>
      becomes active. By pushing
      the cache button you send a request to the server to take all your fields
      into memory - speeding up the interpolation. When you have cached a fieldset,
      the fieldset will be fast for anyone who is using it. The caching process
      is running in background and takes up to one minute. Its finished when the
      red blinking icon <img SRC="busy.gif"  BORDER=0> vanishes.
      <p>
     <B>BOOKMARS</b><br>
      One can easyly define bookmarks in tseries. By pushing the  <img SRC="list-add.xpm"  BORDER=0> button one can add      new folder to the Bookmarks. Just doubleclick on the NEW folder and rename it.
      Now one can drag positions from the other folders there. Rename the 
      bookmarks as you wish. There are some distributed folders with given positions.
      These can be edited, but will be restored after restart. Private created folders
      will be stored locally ($HOME/.tseries/bookmarks.def)
      All positions can be dragged into trash for removal. Empty private folders are
      automatically removed after restart. Any choosen position is tracked under
      the <b>RECORD</b> folder. Drag from there into a private folder if you want to
      track the actual position.
